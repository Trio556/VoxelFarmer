This is a small demo that I am setting up that will be voxel based.
In the end the least I want out of the demo is the following:
1) Cubed Voxels that allow for dirt to be mined
2) A pickaxe for mining
3) A character to play in that will pick up the pickaxe
4) An inventory system for the player to hold the pickaxe and dirt
5) An enemy to fight that will "hunt" the player down - will only be melee
6) A weapon of some sort that the character can fight with

Refactoring will happen once the base features are added in a separate branch then merged up.

Base Features Completed:
1) Basic Procedural Voxel Terrain
